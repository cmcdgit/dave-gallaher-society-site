            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <div id="story">
                <p>David 'Dave' Gallaher (30 October 1873 - 4 October 1917) was a New Zealand rubgy union footballer,
                    best known as the captain of 'The Originals', the first New Zealand national rubgy union team to be
                    know as the All Blacks. His story began in Ramelton in 1873.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Born in Ramelton, County Donegal, Ireland. Gallaher's family emigrated to New Zealand in 1878.
                    Originally settling in Katikati in the Bay of Plenty, they moved to Auckland in the 1890's and it
                    was there that Gallaher played his provincial rugby.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Gallaher played 26 representative matches for Auckland, including the first ever Ranfurly Shield
                    defence, and 36 for the All Blacks, including 6 tests. Gallaher's All Black career spanned from 1903
                    to 1906, the highlight being the captaincy of the "Originals" tour in which heplayed 26 matches
                    including 4 tests. Gallaher proved to be an outstanding leader and one of the deepest thinkers of
                    the game in his era.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Gallaher fought in the Boer War serving as a corporal in the 6th and 10th New Zealand Contingents of
                    Mounted Rifles. The Irish-born Kiwi's influence on rugby was tragically cut short when he joined the
                    army again, this time to fight in the Great War of 1914-18. Although he was exempt from subscription
                    due to his age, it is believed that he altered his date of birth so he could volunteer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Dave Gallaher died following injuries received in the battle of Paschendale on 4th October 1917. He
                    was just 26 days short of his 44th birthday. He was one of thirteen former All Black rugby players
                    killed in the First World War.
