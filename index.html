            <div id="story">
                <p>
                    Dave Gallaher was born on October 30, 1873, in Ramelton, County Donegal, Ireland. His family emigrated
                    to New Zealand when he was five years old, settling in Katikati, and later moving to Auckland.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Gallaher began his rugby career in New Zealand, playing for the Ponsonby club and then for Auckland.
                    His skills on the field quickly gained recognition, leading to his selection for the New Zealand national team.

                <br>
                <p>
                    In 1905, Gallaher was appointed captain of the "Originals," the first New Zealand national rugby team to tour
                    the Northern Hemisphere. The team is now known as the "All Blacks." Under Gallaher's leadership, the team
                    achieved remarkable success, winning 34 out of 35 matches on the tour. The only loss came against Wales in
                    a match that remains legendary in rugby history.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Gallaher was not only a talented player but also a tactical innovator, contributing to the development of the
                    modern game. His contributions to rugby were significant, and his legacy has endured over the decades.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In addition to his rugby career, Gallaher served in World War I, enlisting in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force.
                    Sadly, he was killed in action on October 4, 1917, during the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium. He was buried
                    at Nine Elms British Cemetery in Poperinghe, Belgium.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Dave Gallaher's impact on rugby and his legacy as a pioneering captain of the All Blacks are still remembered and celebrated today.
