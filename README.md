# Dave Gallaher Society

## Intro

Dave Gallaher is a very important part of the history of Ramelton.  Although Dave did not reside in Ramelton for too many years before he and his family emigrated to New Zealand, the fact that the first captain of the New Zealand rubgy team, known as 'The Originals' was born in a small Donegal town should not be underestimated. The Dave Gallaher Society wishes to protect this legacy and in so doing, promote Ramelton as a place to visit for rubgy and sports fans alike.  The Dave Gallaher Society has an online presence in the form of an official Facebook page but it is hoped that a regularly updated and well maintained website might be a good starting point for anyone interested in learning more about this story.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**
  - The navigation bar is available on all three pages of the site, so that navigating between the different pages is made easy no matter what page the user is currently on. Using the same navigation bar on each page ensures that how a user navigates is consistent across all three pages.

#### Button/Links
