            <h2>The All Blacks' Historic Visit to Ramelton in 2005</h2>
            <div id="story">
                <p>In 2005, the small town of Ramelton in County Donegal, Ireland, was thrust into the international
                    spotlight when it played host to one of the most iconic and revered teams in rugby historyâ€”the New
                    Zealand All Blacks. This momentous event, which marked the culmination of the All Blacks' tour of
                    the British Isles, is still fondly remembered by the locals as a highlight in the town's storied
                    history.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The All Blacks, known for their formidable prowess on the rugby field and their famous pre-match
                    Haka,
                    were on a tour that included fixtures against the national teams of Wales, Ireland, England, and
                    Scotland. Despite their packed schedule, the team made a special visit to Ramelton, thanks to the
                    efforts of local rugby enthusiast John Doherty. Doherty, who had formed a connection with All Blacks
                    coach Graham Henry, managed to persuade the team to make a detour to the picturesque town.

                    Ramelton, with its rich heritage and scenic beauty, provided a charming contrast to the high-octane
                    matches the team was accustomed to. The visit began with a warm welcome from the townspeople, who
                    lined
                    the streets to catch a glimpse of their rugby heroes. The excitement was palpable as the All Blacks,
                    dressed in their distinctive black kit, made their way through the town.

                </div>
                <p>
                    One of the key highlights of the visit was a coaching clinic held by the All Blacks at the local
                    rugby
                    club. Young aspiring rugby players from Ramelton and surrounding areas flocked to the event, eager
                    to
                    learn from the best in the world. The All Blacks, known for their commitment to promoting rugby at
                    all
                    levels, took the youngsters through various drills, sharing tips and techniques that have helped
                    them
                    dominate the sport for over a century.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The day also included a cultural exchange, where the All Blacks performed their traditional Haka,
                    much
                    to the awe and admiration of the local crowd. In return, they were treated to traditional Irish
                    music
                    and dance, showcasing the rich cultural heritage of Ramelton. This mutual exchange of traditions
                    fostered a sense of camaraderie and respect between the visitors and the locals.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The All Blacks' visit was not just about rugby; it was also an opportunity to engage with the
                    community.
                    The players visited local schools, hospitals, and community centers, spreading joy and leaving a
                    lasting
                    impression on everyone they met. Their humility and approachability endeared them to the
                    townspeople,
                    solidifying the bond between Ramelton and the All Blacks.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For the residents of Ramelton, the visit was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that brought the world
                    to
                    their doorstep. It was a testament to the unifying power of sports and a reminder of the global
                    reach of
                    rugby. Even years later, the stories and memories of that day are recounted with great pride and
                    nostalgia.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In the annals of Ramelton's history, the visit by the All Blacks in 2005 remains a cherished
                    chapter,
                    symbolizing a moment when a small Irish town became the center of the rugby universe, if only for a
                    day.
